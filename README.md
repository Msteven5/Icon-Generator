## Description

This application is used to generate SVG files with short lettering up to 3 characters that is when surrounded by a shape of the user's choice, in the coloring of their choice with the font color of their choice as well.

## Installation

This application requires Node and Node Package Manager installs including the Inquirer and Jest packages. These both can be run through the computer terminal to allow for the testing of this code as well as the main application itself.

## Usage

You can use this application to create small, simple logos or icons for whatever the user wishes to use them for, limitless combinations and color choices leave a lot to the imagination.

## Contributing

This coding project was done almost exlusively by myself, Michael Davidson. I had some starter code and a test written by the people at UTA in charge of the bootcamp I am currently attending at the time of creating this project.

## Tests

You can test this application by running npm install jest and npm install inquirer@8.2.4 as those are the dependencies required for this application and from there, you must use the "node index.js" command to test out the functionality of the application itself.
